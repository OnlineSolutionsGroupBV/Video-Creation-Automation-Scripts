# üéÆ Video Creation Automation Scripts

This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed to automate basic video editing tasks using python and ffmpeg. It supports:

- ‚úÖ Converting `.AVI` video files to `.MP4`
- ‚úÖ Concatenating multiple video clips into one
- ‚úÖ Basic handling of video and audio tracks
- ‚úÖ Useful for quickly generating compilation videos or cleaning up camera exports

---

## üßπ Features

- üîÑ **Automatic format conversion** (AVI ‚Üí MP4)
- üéû **Smart concatenation** of video clips (with audio preserved)
- üìÇ **Glob-based file discovery** ‚Äî no need to hardcode filenames
- üîß Built-in `ffmpeg` path config for macOS compatibility
- üí° Clean and easy-to-extend codebase

---

## üë• Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and available at `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install moviepy
```

---

## üìÅ Scripts

### `convert_avi_to_mp4.py`

Scans a folder for `.avi` files and converts them to `.mp4` using MoviePy and FFmpeg.

```bash
python convert_avi_to_mp4.py
```

> Outputs converted files to the same or specified folder.

---

### `merge_video.py`

Finds all `.mp4` files in a folder (e.g. `output/`) and concatenates them into a single video file (`merged_output.mp4`), preserving the audio.

```bash
python merge_video.py
```

> Uses `method="compose"` to ensure compatibility of clips with different dimensions or audio.

---

## ‚öô FFmpeg Path Configuration

For macOS or custom FFmpeg setups, you may need to set the binary paths at the top of your script:

```python
import os
os.environ["FFMPEG_BINARY"] = "/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg"
os.environ["FFPLAY_BINARY"] = "/usr/local/bin/ffplay"
```

## üõ† Future Ideas

- Add optional fade transitions between clips
- Watermark or overlay logo/text
- Batch process subfolders
- GUI or web interface
